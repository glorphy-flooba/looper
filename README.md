# software-looper
little python script to make it sound like your lagging over a voice chat
Making a virtual microphone is very hard in python, so im using the third party software VB-Cable, downloadable here https://vb-audio.com/Cable/

all you need to do to set it up is included in comments in the python script

I made this since a youtuber called plexiate has a bit of using a looper to sound like hes lagging and I thought it was funny
